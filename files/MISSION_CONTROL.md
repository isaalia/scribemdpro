## 🎮 HOW TO SUPERVISE CURSOR (OR ANY AI)

### Your Role: Technical Architect & Project Manager
You're not just asking for code - you're **supervising a development team**. Here's how:

### Step 1: Open Cursor and Load Context
```bash
# In Cursor, open your project folder
# Then open these files in tabs:
- PROJECT_STATE.md
- ARCHITECTURE.md  
- CURSOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- START_HERE.md
```

### Step 2: Give Cursor Its First Assignment

**Option A: Let Cursor Drive (Recommended)**
```
Hi Cursor! I need you to build ScribeMD Pro.

All documentation is ready in the /docs folder:
- PROJECT_STATE.md = current status
- ARCHITECTURE.md = system design
- CURSOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md = your implementation guide
- START_HERE.md = immediate next steps

Please:
1. Read all documentation
2. Understand the architecture
3. Start with PHASE 1, Task 1.1
4. Update PROJECT_STATE.md as you complete tasks
5. Ask questions if anything is unclear

Let's build this! 🚀
```

**Option B: Micro-manage Specific Tasks**
```
Cursor, follow CURSOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md.

Complete Task 1.1: Initialize Monorepo
- Create folder structure as specified
- Setup turbo.json
- Initialize package.json
- Create .gitignore

Show me the commands you'll run before executing.
Update PROJECT_STATE.md when complete.
```

### Step 3: Monitor Progress
After each session:
1. Check `PROJECT_STATE.md` - are checkboxes being marked?
2. Review code - does it match ARCHITECTURE.md?
3. Test features - do they work?
4. Update blockers if stuck

### Step 4: Course Correct When Needed
If Cursor deviates:
```
Cursor, you're not following the architecture.

Check ARCHITECTURE.md section [X].
The database schema specifies [Y].
Your code does [Z] instead.

Please revise to match the architecture exactly.
```

## 🔄 MAINTAINING STATE ACROSS CONVERSATIONS

**The Problem:** AI conversations reset. Context is lost.

**The Solution:** PROJECT_STATE.md is your memory.

### Every Time You Start Working:
1. Open PROJECT_STATE.md
2. Check "Current Task"
3. Tell Cursor: "Continue from [Current Task] in PROJECT_STATE.md"
4. Cursor reads the state and resumes

### Every Time You Finish:
1. Update PROJECT_STATE.md
2. Mark completed checkboxes
3. Update "Current Task"
4. Document any blockers
5. List next 3 priorities

**This way, you NEVER lose your place - even if conversations reset!**

---

## 💪 HOW TO STAY IN CONTROL

### 1. **Review Before Execution**
Never let Cursor run commands blindly. Ask:
```
Cursor, show me the commands you'll run first.
Explain what each command does.
Then I'll approve execution.
```

### 2. **Verify Against Architecture**
After Cursor writes code:
```
Cursor, does this implementation match ARCHITECTURE.md?
Point me to the relevant section.
```

### 3. **Test Frequently**
Don't build for days without testing:
```
Cursor, we've completed [X].
Write a test to verify it works.
Run the test and show me results.
```

### 4. **Update Documentation**
Keep PROJECT_STATE.md current:
```
Cursor, update PROJECT_STATE.md:
- Mark Task 2.3 complete
- Update current phase percentage
- Document blocker: [issue]
- Next task: [what's next]
```

---

## 🚨 WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

### If Cursor Gets Confused:
```
Cursor, let's reset.

1. Read PROJECT_STATE.md - what's our current status?
2. Read ARCHITECTURE.md - what should we be building?
3. What's the next incomplete task?
4. Let's start fresh from there.
```

### If You Lose Your Place:
```
Cursor, I need a status update.

1. What phase are we in?
2. What percentage complete?
3. What's working?
4. What's not working?
5. What should we do next?

Reference PROJECT_STATE.md for answers.
```

### If Code Doesn't Match Architecture:
```
Cursor, audit our code against ARCHITECTURE.md.

Check:
- Database schema matches?
- API endpoints match?
- Authentication flow matches?
- File structure matches?

List any deviations and fix them.
```
