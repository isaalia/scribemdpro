## 🏃 GETTING STARTED (3 STEPS)

### Step 1: Read the Docs (10 minutes)
```
Open in this order:
1. MISSION_CONTROL.md (understand supervision)
2. START_HERE.md (immediate next steps)
3. QUICK_REFERENCE.md (keep this open always)
```

### Step 2: Setup Environment (5 minutes)
```bash
# Create .env.local with all your ENV vars
# You said you have them ready! ✅

VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJxxx...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJxxx...
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=xxx
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxx
DRCHRONO_CLIENT_ID=xxx
DRCHRONO_CLIENT_SECRET=xxx
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx
```

### Step 3: Launch Cursor (Now!)
```
Open Cursor and tell it:

"I need you to build ScribeMD Pro, a medical scribe SaaS platform.

All documentation is ready:
- PROJECT_STATE.md = current status
- ARCHITECTURE.md = complete specs  
- CURSOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md = your guide
- START_HERE.md = begin here

Read the docs, then start with PHASE 1, Task 1.1.
Update PROJECT_STATE.md as you work.

Let's build something legendary! 🚀"
```

## 💪 YOUR SUPERPOWERS

### Power 1: Never Lose Your Place
**Problem:** AI conversations reset and lose context.
**Solution:** PROJECT_STATE.md tracks everything.
- Start each session: "Cursor, check PROJECT_STATE.md and resume"
- Cursor reads current state and continues exactly where you left off
- **You NEVER lose progress**

### Power 2: Total Control
**Problem:** AI tools can go off-track.
**Solution:** ARCHITECTURE.md is the spec.
- Tell Cursor: "Follow ARCHITECTURE.md exactly"
- If Cursor deviates, point it back to the spec
- **You stay in command**

### Power 3: Step-by-Step Guidance
**Problem:** Don't know what to build next.
**Solution:** CURSOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md has all tasks.
- Broken into phases and sub-tasks
- Code templates ready to use
- **Clear roadmap to follow**

## 💰 THE FINANCIAL REALITY

### What You're Saving:
```
Current software costs:
- DeepScribe: $199/mo = $2,388/yr
- DrChrono: ~$400/mo = $4,800/yr
- HealthGorilla: ~$400/mo = $4,800/yr
Total: $12,000/year

ScribeMD Pro cost:
- Supabase: ~$25/mo = $300/yr
- Deepgram: ~$50/mo = $600/yr
- Anthropic: ~$50/mo = $600/yr
- Vercel: Free (then $20/mo) = $240/yr
- Domain: $20/yr
Total: ~$1,760/yr

NET SAVINGS: $10,240/year 💰
```

### What You're Building:
```
At 100 users × $99/mo = $118,800/yr
At 500 users × $79/mo = $474,000/yr
At 1000 users × $79/mo = $948,000/yr

Minus costs (10%) = ~$850k NET profit at scale

This is your retirement fund. 🏝️
